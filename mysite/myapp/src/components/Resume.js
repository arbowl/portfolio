                        A major facet of my resume that I want to highlight is that I am a very capable learner. I learned every technology and skill listed 
                        in my co-ops on the job to drive my projects to success, and retained the skills for my next endeavor. I am teachable, I learn quickly,
                        and I'm reliable. Be sure to check out <b>Portfolio</b> on the sidebar for in-depth looks at some of my projects listed here!

                            "We hired Drew at GSSI as an intern in 2019, and on all counts he exceeded our expectations for performance. Not only did Drew
                            have an excellent work ethic, requiring little supervision, but he wasn't afraid to ask questions or ask for help and
                            clarification when needed. He had attention to detail and delivered a working motion control test platform which we use today
                            for testing our radars and antennas. I highly recommend Drew not only for his enthusiasm and work ethic, but for his willingness
                            to push through challenges and the focus to get to the end result.‚Äù

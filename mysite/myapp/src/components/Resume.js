                        A major facet of my resume that I want to highlight is that I am a very capable learner. I learned every technology and skill listed 
                        in my co-ops on the job to drive my projects to success, and retained the skills for my next endeavor. I am teachable, I learn quickly,
                        and I'm reliable. Be sure to check out my <a href="/portfolio"><u>Portfolio</u></a>!

                                        have an excellent work ethic, requiring little supervision, but he wasn't afraid to ask questions or ask for help and
                                        clarification when needed. He had attention to detail and delivered a working motion control test platform which we use today
                                        for testing our radars and antennas. I highly recommend Drew not only for his enthusiasm and work ethic, but for his willingness
                                        to push through challenges and the focus to get to the end result.‚Äù</i>
